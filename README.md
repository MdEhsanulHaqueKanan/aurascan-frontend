cd aurascan-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This will download all the necessary packages for the project.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the Development Server
This command starts the local Vite development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the App
Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

**Important:** For the application to function correctly, the [AuraScanAI backend server](https://github.com/MdEhsanulHaqueKanan/aurascan-api) must be running, either locally on port 5000 or on its public Hugging Face URL. The frontend's API target URL can be configured in the `src/services/auraScanService.ts` file.
